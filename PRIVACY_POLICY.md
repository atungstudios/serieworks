# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: September 3, 2025**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Serieworks ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile applications (the "Service" or "Apps").

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device
- **App preferences and settings**: To maintain your preferred app configuration
- **Premium subscription status**: To manage access to premium content (where applicable)
- **User progress and data**: To save your progress and app-specific information
- **Audio and media preferences**: To remember your preferred playback settings (where applicable)

### Information We Do NOT Collect
- We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers
- We do not track your location
- We do not access your contacts, photos, or other personal data without explicit permission
- We do not collect any information that can identify you personally

## How We Use Information

The information stored locally on your device is used to:
- Provide and maintain our app services
- Remember your subscription status and app preferences
- Save your progress and user data
- Improve your user experience within our apps

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage Only**: All your data is stored locally on your device using secure platform storage mechanisms
- **No External Transmission**: Your personal data never leaves your device
- **Secure Storage**: We use platform-provided secure local storage methods (such as Android SharedPreferences, iOS UserDefaults, or similar secure storage APIs)

## In-App Purchases

Some of our apps may offer premium content through in-app purchases:
- Purchase transactions are handled securely by Google Play Store or Apple App Store
- We only receive confirmation of successful purchases to unlock premium features
- We do not store or process your payment information

## Third-Party Services

Our apps may use the following third-party services:
- **Google Play Store / Apple App Store**: For app distribution and in-app purchase processing (where applicable)
- **Device System Services**: For accessing device features like audio, camera, or storage (only when explicitly needed for app functionality)

These services have their own privacy policies and terms of service.

## Children's Privacy

Our apps are designed for general audiences and do not specifically target children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since all data is stored locally on the device and no information is transmitted to our servers, no personal information is collected from users of any age.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.

## Data Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- You can delete all app data by uninstalling the application
- You can reset your data through the app's settings (where available)
- No data needs to be deleted from external servers as none is stored there

## App-Specific Information

Different apps may have specific features or data handling practices. Any app-specific privacy information will be clearly disclosed within the respective app or in app-specific privacy notices.
